SETTING UP JSPTEST FOR DEVELOPMENT IN ECLIPSE

In order to begin developing JspTest in Eclipse, you need to perform the
following two steps:

1. Generate the Eclipse project files

  The Eclipse project files (.project and .classpath) are not kept in
  version control. You can let Maven generate those files for you by 
  executing the following command in the console/command prompt from 
  the checked out root directory: 

  $ mvn eclipse:eclipse

2. Generate the M2_REPO classpath variable

  The Maven Eclipse plugin generates the .classpath file with 
  references to a classpath variable named "M2_REPO", which doesn't 
  exist by default so you need to create it by executing the following
  command:

  $ mvn -Declipse.workspace=<path-to-eclipse-workspace> eclipse:add-maven-repo

3. Import the JspTest modules as separate projects 

  JspTest is organized as a multi-module Maven project, which means that
  we'll have one Eclipse project per module. In order to import the 
  modules as regular Java projects into Eclipse, perform the following 
  steps in Eclipse:

  * Import > Existing Projects into Workspace
  * Type the checked-out root directory and click "Refresh"
  * Select all listed jsptest-* projects and click "Finish"
